# PFF_EE-Quiz
EE-Quiz for PFF screening
Tyler Grandahl - July 27th 2017

The design files are provided in response to the following request:

Using KiCAD, design a circuit schematic for an analog amplifier with the following features:
-Uses a 5VDC power supply. Assumes the signal to be amplified shares the same ground as the power supply.
-Amplifies an input analog signal that can range from 0 to 2.0V so that the output ranges from 0 to 5V.
-Contains a bill of materials (BOM) specifying the chosen components and how to source them.
-Has an adjustable gain. And a low-pass filter with adjustable cut-off to filter-out noise from the input analog signal.
-OPTIONAL: Is implemented as a routed PCB.
 
The design can be submitted as a GitHub repository file containing the KiCAD project and a printable (Letter) PDF with the schematic and if available another PDF in 1:1 scale of the routed PCB.
